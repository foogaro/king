Completed. Go to overview.
A new data service has been created in your project.  The username/password for accessing the service is teiidUser/admin.2017.  Please be sure to create the "datavirt-service-account" service account and the following secrets: "datavirt-app-config" containing the datasource configuration details required by the deployed VDB(s); "datavirt-app-secret" containing the keystore.jks file used for serving secure content; "datavirt-app-secret" containing the jgroups.jceks file used for securing JGroups communications.
Manage your app

The web console is convenient, but if you need deeper control you may want to try our command line tools.
Command line tools

Download and install the oc command line tool. After that, you can start by logging in, switching to this particular project, and displaying an overview of it, by doing:

oc login https://publicpaas.openshift.openline.nl:8443
oc project king-poc
oc status

For more information about the command line tools, check the CLI Reference and Basic CLI Operations.
Applied Parameter Values

These parameters often include things like passwords. If you will need to reference these values later, copy them to a safe location. Parameters HOSTNAME_HTTP, HOSTNAME_HTTPS, HOSTNAME_JDBC, EXTENSIONS_DOCKERFILE, HTTPS_KEYSTORE_TYPE, MODESHAPE_USERNAME, MODESHAPE_PASSWORD, GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET, GENERIC_WEBHOOK_SECRET, JGROUPS_CLUSTER_PASSWORD were generated automatically.
